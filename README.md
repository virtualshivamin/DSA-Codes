# DSA Codes

🚀 A collection of my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) codes** written while learning, practicing, and solving problems from platforms like **LeetCode, HackerRank, and CodeChef**.

This repository serves as my personal DSA practice archive, and also as a resource for anyone who wants to learn or revise important DSA concepts through code.

---

## 📌 Contents

* Implementation of core **Data Structures** (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, heaps, hashmaps, etc.)
* Classic **Algorithms** (sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming, backtracking, greedy, graph algorithms, etc.)
* Solutions to **LeetCode**, **HackerRank**, and **CodeChef** problems.
* Well-structured and commented code for better understanding.

---

## 🛠 Languages Used

* **C++** (primary)
* May include some solutions in **Java/Python** (as I explore other languages).

---

## 🎯 Goals

* Strengthen my problem-solving skills.
* Build a strong foundation in DSA for **competitive programming** and **placements**.
* Create a reference repo for quick revision before contests/interviews.
